# Introduction to R Workshop via Rstudio: Description

## 1. Overview

The goal of this workshop is to teach novice programmers to write code in R for data analysis. R is a free, open source and cross-platform software for manipulating datasets and producing statistical plots and analyses. R is commonly used in many scientific disciplines for statistical analysis.

The emphasis of this workshop is to give attendees a strong foundation in the fundamentals of R, and to teach them how to use the packages from R to manipulate, analyse and visualise data. This workshop is also intended as an opportunity for attendees to meet and network with the community that is actively using R for research.

*Note that this workshop will focus on teaching the fundamentals of the programming language R, and will not teach statistical analysis. If you would like help with your statistical analysis, you can contact the [Statistical Consulting Centre](http://www.scc.ms.unimelb.edu.au/) for one-on-one consultations statistical training courses.*

*A variety of third party packages are used throughout this workshop. These are not necessarily the best, nor are they comprehensive, but they are packages we find useful, and have been chosen primarily for their usability.*

### Learning Objectives

This training aims to enable students to:

- Use the RStudio interface effectively.
  
- Understand the different data types and structures used in R.
  
- Import, manipulate and clean data.
  
- Obtain simple summary statistics from data.
  
- Visualise data in a meaningful and elegant way.

### Learning Outcomes

- The ability to generate reproducible analysis of quantitative data using statistical and visualisation tools.
  
- Computational skills: The ability to adapt existing computational methods and tools to complete a target task.
  
- Problem solving skills: the ability to engage with unfamiliar problems and identify relevant solution strategies.
  
- Collaborative skills: the ability to work in a team.

### Training Format

The Introduction to R workshop consists of a 4-hour session followed by a 3-hour session. Both sessions are delivered in one single day from 9am to 5pm. Workshops are delivered monthly (Feb-Nov) and participants are encouraged to return two to 3 times to practice their skills.

- **Duration:** 7 hours.
  
- **Frequency:** Monthly.
  
- **Mode of presentation:** Physical presence with a 5% e-learning video component.
  
- **Materials**: Participants can follow the [course material online](TODO: JEREMY LINK). Students also have access to a [book](https://nikkirubinstein.gitbooks.io/resguides-introductory-r-workshop/content/content/01-rstudio-intro.html) that explores the concepts introduced in the workshop in more depth.


## 2. Eligibility requirements

This workshop is accessible to everyone. We encourage non-coders and people from different backgrounds and skills to register for the training.

### Prerequisites

**NO previous knowledge is required.**

### Recommended background knowledge

For those with no previous programming experience, we recommend consulting the course materials for [introduction to programming concepts](https://nikkirubinstein.gitbooks.io/resguides-introductory-programming-concepts/content/content/welcome-to-coding.html ) prior to attending the current workshop.

### Participation requirements
- **Participants must bring a laptop and charger** with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, ipad etc.) in which they have administrative privileges on.
- **Participants should [install R and Rstudio](https://resbaz.github.io/installRinstructions/) before the workshop.**

## 3. Assessment and Expectations

- We encourage participants to come with an open mind and participate in discussions with others.
  
- This workshop is a hands on training. We expect participants to code and ask questions to the trainer and, more importantly, to other students.

- Particpants are expected to work in teams during the day.

- Participants will be asked to self-assess their progress and understanding of concepts.

- Students are expected to provide feedback to improve the course.
